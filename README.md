# Marketing Mix Modeling using Robyn

In this project, I aim to explore and understand how can I perform end-to-end Marketing Mix Modeling using Robyn, an open source library in R developed by Meta's Marketing Science division. 

## Instructions
- For installing Robyn, refer to the robyn_installation R script. 
- For executing the code, refer to the robyn_execution R script.

I haven't performed much of an EDA on the dataset as it was a simulated dataset. But all the EDA results are present within graphs\EDA\ and the script I used for EDA is robyn_EDA.R  

I've written an in-depth article explaining the entire process on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@rochan-n/understanding-marketing-mix-modeling-with-metas-robyn-7f1792ec9273).
